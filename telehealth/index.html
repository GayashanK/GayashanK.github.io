        <p>
          To get started, download the application repository from Codecanyon to
          your local machine.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Extract Codecanyon Files</h4>
        <p>
          Extract the downloaded Codecanyon files into the project directory.
          You can use a file compression tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip on Windows or
          the unzip command on Linux/macOS to extract the contents.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Installation Instructions</h4>
        <p>
          Install <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>npm</strong> if they are
          not already installed. You can download them from
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org/</a>.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Install npm Packages</h4>
        <p>
          Navigate to the project folder and install the required npm packages:
        </p>
        <pre><code>cd your-app-directory
npm install</code></pre>

        <h4>5. Configuration</h4>
        <p>
          Create a configuration file for firebase and other third-party
          services - please follow
          <a href="#configurations">Setup and Configuration</a>
        </p>

        <h4>6. Run the Application</h4>
        <p>Start the development server:</p>
        <pre><code>npm start</code></pre>
        You can now access the application in your web browser at
        <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.

        <h4>7. Development Workflow</h4>
        <p>
          During development, make changes to the code, commit them using Git,
          and push to the repository.
        </p>
        <pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push</code></pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3 id="folderstructure">
          <strong>C. Folder Structure</strong>
        </h3>

        <img
          src="assets/images/file_structure.png"
          style="width: 200px !important"
          alt="Folder Structure"
        />

        <p>
          The project's folder structure is organized to maintain a clean and
          manageable codebase. Below is an overview of the main directories and
          their purposes:
        </p>

        <h4>1. <code>src</code></h4>
        <p>
          The <code>src</code> directory contains the core application code.
          It's the heart of your React project.
        </p>

        <h4>2. <code>services</code></h4>
        <p>
          The <code>services</code> directory holds modules responsible for
          making API calls and handling data fetching. Separating API-related
          logic into this directory helps maintain a clean separation of
          concerns.
        </p>

        <h4>3. <code>components</code></h4>
        <p>
          The <code>components</code> directory contains reusable React
          components that are used throughout the application. Organizing
          components in this directory promotes code reusability and
          maintainability.
        </p>

        <h4>4. <code>pages</code></h4>
        <p>
          The <code>pages</code> directory includes main pages or views of the
          application. Each page typically corresponds to a specific route or
          URL. This separation makes it easier to manage and navigate the
          application's structure.
        </p>

        <h4>5. <code>scss</code></h4>
        <p>
          The <code>scss</code> directory contains SCSS (Sass) files for styling
          the application. Using a preprocessor like SCSS helps maintain clean
          and modular CSS styles.
        </p>

        <h4>6. <code>hooks</code></h4>
        <p>
          The <code>hooks</code> directory can be used to store custom React
          hooks. These hooks encapsulate shared logic and state management for
          components.
        </p>

        <h4>7. <code>config</code></h4>
        <p>
          The <code>config</code> directory may contain configuration files or
          settings used throughout the application, such as environment
          variables or constants.
        </p>

        <h4>Other Files</h4>
        <p>
          In the root directory, you will find important project files like
          <code>package.json</code>, which manages project dependencies, and
          <code>.gitignore</code>, which specifies files and directories to be
          ignored by Git version control.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="configurations">
          <strong>D. Configurations</strong>
        </h3>

        <p>
          To configure Firebase for your Doctor-Patient Video Appointment
          Application, follow these steps:
        </p>

        <h4>1. Create a Firebase Project</h4>
        <p>
          If you don't already have a Firebase project, go to the
          <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase Console</a>
          and create a new project for your application.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Obtain Firebase Configuration</h4>
        <p>
          After creating the project, go to the project settings, and navigate
          to the "General" tab. Scroll down to the "Your apps" section and click
          on the Firebase SDK snippet icon.
        </p>
        <pre><code>// Your Firebase configuration object will look like this:
      const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
          messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
          appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
          measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
      };
      </code></pre>

        <h4>3. Replace Firebase Configuration</h4>
        <p>
          Replace the Firebase configuration in your application code with the
          one obtained from your Firebase project settings. You can usually find
          this code in a file like <code>firebase.js</code> or
          <code>firebaseConfig.js</code>.
        </p>
        <pre><code>// Import Firebase modules
      import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
      import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";
      import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
      import { getStorage } from "firebase/storage";
      
      // Replace with your Firebase configuration
      const firebaseConfig = {
          apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
          authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
          projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
          storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
          messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
          appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
          measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
      };
      
      // Initialize Firebase
      const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
      
      // Initialize Firebase Authentication and get a reference to the service
      export const auth = getAuth(app);
      export const storage = getStorage();
      const analytics = getAnalytics(app);
      </code></pre>

        <h4>4. Enable Authentication Providers</h4>
        <p>
          In your Firebase project settings, navigate to the "Authentication"
          section. Under the "Sign-in method" tab, enable the authentication
          providers you want to use, such as Email/Password, Anonymous,
          Facebook, and Google.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Firebase Storage</h4>
        <p>
          You can use Firebase Storage to store and serve user-generated
          content. Make sure to configure your Firebase Storage rules to suit
          your application's security requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          With these steps, you'll have Firebase configured for your
          Doctor-Patient Video Appointment Application, including the necessary
          Firebase Authentication providers and Firebase Storage for data
          storage.

        <h3 id="authentication">
          <strong>F. Authentication</strong>
        </h3>

        <p>
          The Doctor-Patient Video Appointment Application utilizes Firebase
          Authentication for user authentication. Below, we explain how
          authentication works in our application.
        </p>

        <h4>1. User Registration</h4>
        <p>
          Users can register for an account using their email and password.
          Firebase Authentication securely stores user credentials and provides
          the necessary mechanisms for user management.
        </p>

        <h4>2. User Login</h4>
        <p>
          To access the application, users can log in with their registered
          email and password. Firebase Authentication verifies user credentials
          and issues a unique authentication token upon successful login.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Token-Based Authentication</h4>
        <p>
          After a user logs in, the application sends an authentication token to
          the backend server. This token serves as proof of the user's identity
          and is used to authorize access to protected resources and perform
          actions on behalf of the user.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Secure Communication</h4>
        <p>
          The authentication token is used to ensure secure communication
          between the frontend and the backend. All requests to the backend are
          validated against this token to prevent unauthorized access.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Password Reset</h4>
        <p>
          Users can initiate a password reset if they forget their login
          credentials. Firebase Authentication provides a secure password reset
          process via email.
        </p>

        <p>
          By utilizing Firebase Authentication, we ensure a secure and
          user-friendly authentication process, allowing users to access the
          Doctor-Patient Video Appointment Application with confidence.
        </p>

        <h3 id="realtimecommunication">
          <strong>G. Real-time Communication (Twilio Video)</strong>
        </h3>

        <p>
          The Doctor-Patient Video Appointment Application leverages Twilio
          Video for real-time video communication between patients and doctors.
          Below, we outline the process of setting up and using Twilio Video in
          our application.

        <p>
          To use Twilio Video, you'll need to sign up for a Twilio account. If
          you haven't already, you can create an account on the
          <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio website</a>. Once registered,
          navigate to the Twilio Console to access your API keys and secrets.
        </p>

        <h4>2. API Keys and Secrets</h4>
        <p>
          In the Twilio Console, you can generate API keys and secrets that will
          be used in your application to interact with Twilio Video services.
          These credentials are essential for secure communication.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Access Tokens from Backend</h4>
        <p>
          To establish video connections, your application's backend should
          provide access tokens to users. These tokens grant temporary access to
          Twilio Video services. The backend generates these tokens by using
          your Twilio API keys and secrets and sends them to the frontend when a
          user initiates a video call.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Frontend Integration</h4>
        <p>
          In the frontend of your application, use the Twilio Video SDK for
          React to create video call interfaces and initiate video sessions. You
          can find documentation and examples for integrating Twilio Video into
          your React application on the
          <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/sdk"
            >Twilio Video SDK for React documentation</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h4>5. Secure and Reliable Video Calls</h4>

          Twilio Video offers secure and reliable real-time video communication.
          It supports features such as participant management, screen sharing,
